## Odra x Fondant

Bridging the Gap for Casper Smart Contract Development & Testing

Odra is the recommended framework for building smart contracts on the Casper Network. Fondant, a new and exciting tool, simplifies running a local Casper network and testing contracts with its intuitive UI. As both tools evolve, we can expect closer integration in the future.

This guide will demonstrate how to combine Odra and Fondant today. We'll create a simple Odra contract, deploy it and test it on a local network using livenet. We'll also provide a script to fetch secret keys from Fondant for seamless interaction.
