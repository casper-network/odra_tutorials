A simple "counter" smart contract using Odra. This is a relatively simple contract, with the idea being that you can use this as your gateway into the world of Odra programming. We cover the approach to building this contract both in Casper 1.x and using Odra, in order to demonstrate the differences for developers coming from the Casper 1.x environment.
